Problem:

    Too many arguments.

Expected request scheme:

    SetupTest setup MODE [PATH]

Available MODEs (case insensitive):

    GET   : get the user specific setup to stdout.
    SET   : set the user specific setup from a given file.
    RESET : reset the user specific setup to default values.

Additional parameter (only in MODE SET):

    PATH : a path to the input file.
